**Notice 1: A live demo will be presented at the poster for the first hour of the session.**

**Notice 2: Version 1.0 will be released in the next few days. A very early build is already available, but I strongly recommend that you wait for the full release as it will contain expanded compatibility, better performance, and more.**
