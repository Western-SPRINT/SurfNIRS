# SurfNIRS: Surf Your fNIRS Data with Ease!
Hello SurfIR! Welcome to SurfNIRS, an all-in-one data surfer for NIRS data. This project is currently under active development so please check back for regular updates. Feedback and feature suggestions are welcome!

# Roadmap
* SurfNIRS v0.1 was released in April 2024 and contains all **core** features including support for AnalyzIRâ€™s nirs.core.Data format.
* Leading up to September 2024, all **planned** features will be implemented with support extended to include at minimum: SNIRF, Homer3, and FANBIDS. Documentation and an example dataset will also be added to GitHub during this time.
* Following September 2024, **proposed** features will be introduced based on interest and these will likely prioritize quality control (e.g., montage colour-coded by SCI).
